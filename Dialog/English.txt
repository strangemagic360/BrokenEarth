Time for a day of exploring!

A08=
[MADELINE left surprised]
That's a lot of blades!
Is it possible to get through the top path?\

A09=
[MADELINE left upset]
What was the point of all that?

Fall=
[MADELINE left surprised]
That seems to be a long way down.
[MADELINE left distracted]
and there doesn't seem to be any way past those spikes...
[MADELINE left determined]
Only one way to find out, I suppose.

The city that once was, now lies in ruin.
The earth takes back what belongs to her.
Over the years, the plants, they grew in.
In the spaces that buildings once were.

Lore02=

Though here it seems the trees now grow.
The earth has something to hide.
There is corruption down below.
That must be removed from inside.

Theo! What are you doing here?

[THEO right normal]
Just checking out the local sites!

[MADELINE left upset]
Last time you did that, I wound up carrying you through the temple.

[THEO right normal]
Oh, don't worry, that won't happen again!
